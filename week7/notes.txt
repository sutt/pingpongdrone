    Basic camera setup
        test with script
    
    Build a better writing demo
        
        apply test driven dev
            record some samples, and do different operation on them
        
        Writing effects
            accel sets whether writing applies, or the thickness at least
                derive accel
                apply lead, lag, and averaging
            
            slower decay
        
        Avoid FP's
            derive an "fp mask", sample the background for 5seconds, 
            since the camera, background doesn't change
            
            take any region that matches and put it on a suspect list
            regions on this list wont register a match unless none other is found
            
            Could create a re-imbue, if two matches, put the tip right up to the camera and establish that as the main one, then use nearest neighbors tracking to establish the true object
