# 2.16

    Copy necessary files to week3 to run steering
    Then build a time logging on Motor step func
    Then check if Motor has latency?
        -> yes a 15ms, every 33 writes
        
    Try a threading app with locks
        build a joystick class
    
    
    Misc
        800 steps back and forth 100x times, does it end same place?
            Note - every flight ~ 20 secs / 80 dir changes, gives chance to recalib motor so this isn't a huge problem to p.o.c.
        Finer resolution for time logging?
